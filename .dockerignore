# Go build cache / modules (if not needed in image context)
# vendor/ # if you use go mod vendor and don't want it in the image if already built from cache
# If you are building in a CI/CD pipeline that always starts fresh, vendor might not be needed in copy.
# If go mod download is effective, vendor isn't strictly needed to be copied.

# Local configuration files that might contain secrets
# config.yaml # Add this if you intend to provide config solely via env vars to the container
# For this exercise, config.yaml is copied by Dockerfile, so it's not ignored.
# If config.yaml had secrets, it should be here.
