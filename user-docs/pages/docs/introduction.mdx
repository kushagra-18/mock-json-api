# Introduction to Mock Data Generation

Welcome to the user guide for our mock data generation feature! This tool allows you to create realistic placeholder data for your projects using a simple template language powered by Faker.js.

With this feature, you can:
- Generate diverse data types like names, addresses, numbers, dates, and more.
- Define the structure of your mock data, including nested objects and arrays.
- Use a wide range of Faker.js modules to produce highly specific and contextual data.

This documentation will guide you through how to write data templates and explore the available data generation capabilities.
